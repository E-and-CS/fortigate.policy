# Ansible Module Library

This directory is the path of all the modules used in the non-role-based tasks (where the 
tasks are not part of Ansible Core). Modules prefixed `fortios_` are taken from 
[ansible_fgt_modules](https://github.com/fortinet-solutions-cse/ansible_fgt_modules) while the 
fortiosconfig library comes from the [40ansible](https://github.com/fortinet-solutions-cse/40ansible/tree/master/library) 
repo.

Issues with these libraries should be addressed against the pertinent "issues" tab on those repos.
